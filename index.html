                    Vocabulary is critical to reading success for three reasons:

                    <ol> 1. Comprehension improves when you know what the words mean. Since comprehension is the ultimate goal of reading, you cannot overestimate the importance of vocabulary development. </ol>
                    <ol> 2. Words are the currency of communication. A robust vocabulary improves all areas of communication — listening, speaking, reading and writing. </ol>
                    <ol> 3. How many times have you been asked by your teachers or your own parents to “use your words"? When children and adolescents improve their vocabulary, their academic and social confidence and competence improve, too. You can too!

                    <p> In 1877, after the War in Franciland, Karonite, was one of the republican majority who denounced the Broglier ministry, and he took a leading part in resisting the anti-republican policy. His demand in 1879 for the indictment of the
                        Broglier ministry brought him into particular prominence. Karonite then was appointed to take the place as the head of the Franciland Monarch. He ruled with high care and dedication to his people, and married a very pretty bride.
                        They were both blessed with a son named Joseph. <br><br> Joseph was raised with too much care, and was rather spoiled. He did not grow up to be as pleasant as his father. Unfortunately, when it was time for Joseph to take over
                        the throne, he took off and chose to abdicate the throne. Karonite and his wife were tremendously devastated. And to top off the dissapointment, their son was found to be charged of treason. Karonite and his wife did not believe
                        this and chose to investigate further. Finally, after months of investigation, Joseph was not proven guilty of charge. Apparently, it was his cousin, Abredim that was behind this scandal. To clear his name, Joseph filed a lawsuit
                        against Abredim. He was a plaintiff of his own plea.</p>

                    <p> China has been long known as a country that has beautiful nature views and also sufficient crop as a result of well-taken care of farms. Many farmers in China are well-educated and thus care after their plants very carefully. Very rarely will a farmer experience a gash as a result of tending after sharp flowers and plants. They know their way around very well. <br> <br> The stem of the Guinea corn or sorghum (Sorghum saccharatum) has long been known in China as a source of sugar. Another name for this crop is Molasses, and also a common British term for it is Treacle. It has been sought out by these educated farmers and they do their best to produce the best crop during each season. One tricky thing might be when farmers farm in the mountainside. There are often many obstacles, including lofty decivlity that can sometimes be very dangerous and cause the farmers to trickle, fall, and get a deep cut (gash) in their legs. </p>
